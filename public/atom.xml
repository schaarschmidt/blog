    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/developers-and-entrepreneurs/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>What follows is not a fictional account, but some details have been changed to protect the innocent.</h3>

<p>There are two types of people in the entrepreneurship community.</p>

<p>Doers, and fund-seekers.</p>

<p>Or, as it is commonly boiled down to on many circles, developers, and the suits.</p>

<p>But like all analogies, it isn&#8217;t a good one - in other words, sometimes you can&#8217;t call an apple an apple, and an orange an orange. The lines get blurred, but this blog post is to highlight some of the differences.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was at a event at the local incubator - a bit of a networking event, community outreach, lunch, and just a general meet and greet event.</p>

<p>Halfway through lunch, a local investor arrived, and did a quick pitch to the massed and attentive throng. As he finished, he announced that he would be off in another part of the building, answering questions.</p>

<p>(there was a previous local investor who had announced the same thing, but I wasn&#8217;t in the room at the time, and therefore I can&#8217;t comment on it.)</p>

<p>It was then that I noticed there were <strong>two</strong> groups of people in the room.</p>

<p>Those who had projects, and those who had ideas. It showed itself in how they composed themselves around the investor. Those who had projects were mildly (and dare I say politely) interested in what he had to say, but there wasn&#8217;t a serious interest</p>

<p>On the other hand, the suits/&#8221;fund-seekers&#8221; reminded me more of a pack of wolves than a group of people who were there to conduct business.</p>

<p>After the the second local investor finished talking, he headed over to his area and took a seat. Within moments, the group had split three ways - one group went to the investor that mentioned a smaller amount of money, another went to the larger-scale investor, and a <em>very</em> small group went and grabbed more food, some coffee, returned to their laptops, and went to work.</p>

<p>The parallel and contrast was striking.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you have those who had &#8220;real work&#8221; to do, and on the other, you had those whose entire purpose of being there was to wine and dine the people with money, and leave those who would probably eventually provide the sweat, blood and tears that all products require to go and invest some sweat, blood and tears.</p>

<p>So, tell me: is this what being an entrepreneur is all about? Are the people who build things not important? Are people <em>that</em> intimidated to learn how to do something (like learn to code) for themselves, so they can ship?</p>

<p><img src="http://shipitsquirrel.github.com/images/ship%20it%20squirrel.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Excuse me, I&#8217;ve spent enough time writing this. Back to shipping folks.</p>

Stack Exchange has decided to do a winter hat bash.</p>

<p>so, you might see something like this when you login to Ask Ubuntu today:</p>

And if you dislike hats, there is an opt-out button - just click the &#8220;i hate hats&#8221; link, and you won&#8217;t see any hats.</p>

<p>Just remember, hats are only around from now until Janurary 4th, so be quick!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/dropbox-to-ubuntu-one-for-note-taking/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-17T18:46:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/dropbox-to-ubuntu-one-for-note-taking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>This solution no longer works. I&#8217;m keeping it around because it is still one of the most visited blog posts.</h2>

<p>Citing a need to completely move their infrastructure, <a href="http://voices.canonical.com/ubuntuone/2013/02/04/notification-about-notes/">the Ubuntu One team announced that they will no longer be supporting note sync</a>.</p>

<p>As such, I have moved to <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, and very gladly fork over $6 a month to them for premium.</p>

<p>So, for those of you who know me, I&#8217;m pretty picky
about what I use for my syncing. And I have to be -
this is one of the more difficult parts of my electronic life,
and its even more difficult now.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with my requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>free as in beer if at all possible. Hey, I&#8217;m cheap.</li>
<li>clients for the following OS&#8217;s:

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>Android. (I know, I need to clean up my operating system variety)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some sort of folder structure, at least for the desktop.</li>
<li>Markdown is nice, but not required.</li>
</ul>


<p>Before I added Android to the mix, I had been using
PlainText and Dropbox. Worked wonderfully.
Now that I have an android device,
I&#8217;m moving to Ubuntu One notes, aka tomboy. Seems to work pretty well.</p>

<p>For Windows and Ubuntu clients, I&#8217;m using Tomboy.
For Android, I&#8217;m using <a href="https://launchpad.net/tomdroid">Tomdroid</a>,
and for iOS, I&#8217;m using a new one that doesn&#8217;t work on iOS6 (yet!),
but should get fixed soon, called
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webnotes-powered-by-ubuntu/id519580240?mt=8">webNotes (powered by Ubuntu One)</a>. All the platforms covered yay!</p>

<p>To get setup, I just installed Tomboy on my Ubuntu
and Windows computers.
I then installed the beta version of Tomdroid,
and connected everything to my Ubuntu One account.
Took about 20 minutes to do the switch, and was very painless!</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve been using Ubuntu One in this fashion for about three months,
and it&#8217;s going pretty well so far.</p>

<p>The ability to have my notes anywhere is great - and the fact it
integrates with a product made by one of my favorite companies (Canonical)
is even better!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/railsrumble2012-a-beginners-postmortem/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-19T18:46:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/railsrumble2012-a-beginners-postmortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought I was a fairly competent and accomplished rails developer, for someone who was self taught, never had a job doing rails stuff, and who was young enough that a large part of the community is old enough be my dad.</p>

<p>And then I entered the Rails Rumble for 2012 with <a href="https://twitter.com/imnotanerd">@imnotanerd</a>, and spent a desperate 48 hours with my battling oauth, rails internals, Sinatra, cancan, and a Linux server.</p>

<p>At the end, I&#8217;ve got a few takeaways.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Come up with two ideas - one that only takes 12 hours to build, the other that takes the full 48.</p>

<p>This saved our bacon. We had two ideas - one was fairly complex. At 8PM Saturday I said &#8220;look. We&#8217;ve been banging our heads against this for almost 8 man hours. Time to start something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I did a rails new, and thus Volla was born. Or reborn.</p></li>
<li><p>Git is your frenemy.</p>

<p>Git is a blessing and a curse. Commit early, often, push, deploy via Capistrano, repeat.</p>

<p>But make sure that your gitignore is properly updated.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you end up committing 20mb worth of binstubs. And your api keys. Not OK.</p>

<p>Anyway. Don&#8217;t do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Stay on target&#8230;</p>

<p>Enough said. Don&#8217;t get distracted by the cool matrix cat or something.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#8217;t succeed, try again.
Take a month off, then try that idea again. I learned everything I know about rails because I said &#8220;I&#8217;ve got two weeks. Let&#8217;s building something in 2 hours a day&#8221;. (Side note: that&#8217;s how I got sucked into Shoes/Hackety Hack, as well as delayed_paperclip. You devote time to something, you will fill it. Fact of life that I&#8217;ve discovered over the past 16 years I&#8217;ve been around on this planet.)</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage the knowledge of others.</p>

<p>I did the math, and between the two of us, we spent 8 hours man hours trying to figure out sessions in Sinatra. It was at this point I said &#8220;stop and move on, lets get this fixed&#8221;. Time spent on authentication in rails? 20 minutes. (Authorization though, was closer to an hour, hour and a half)</p>

<p>The lesson to take away from this is that for almost everything you&#8217;re doing, someone has invented that wheel already - so for the love of pete, USE IT. Thats the wonderful thing about a community.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#8217;t know what adding $GEM to your gemfile will do, you probably don&#8217;t want to do it.</p>

<p>I ran into this - had a gem, added it, broke everything. Removed, worked fine. (Not naming names here, it was some bad code I wrote elsewhere). But adding <em>one</em> gem was enough to break the whole app.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a logged chat.</p>

<p>We used skype - this worked, but the logs in skype are&#8230; well, less than wonderful. Part of this has to do with Skype for Linux, part of this has to do with Skype in general. If I had to do it again, I&#8217;d use Campfire, or even IRC.</p></li>
<li><p>Descriptive git commits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fixed bugs&#8221; - If you&#8217;re guilty of this, raise your hand! Oh look, everyones hand went up.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t. Do. This. Ever. Makes code review after the fact hard.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#8217;re confident, do some sort of TDD.</p>

<p>This would have cost us time, but saved us trouble. If we had automated testing in place, I would have known that we broke certain things with certain other changes. But&#8230; well, hindsight is 20-20.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Hopefully my tips here will be useful for people in the future. If not, oh well. I tried. :)</p>

    <updated>2012-03-08T09:06:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/leadership-lessons-from-battlestar-galactica</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I realized one thing about leadership during the period of exodus from the twelve worlds. A leader, no matter how benevolently he regards himself, has to be something of a tyrant. If he lets everyone in on every phase of his plan, allows them to see the <em>overpowering</em> odds against them, he takes the risk they&#8217;ll become too discouraged to perform the little jobs that bring us forward through all the tedious phases.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t normally look for leadership lessons in science fiction - but, when I was reading <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, this part stuck out at me.</p>

<p>Lets go through this piece by piece.</p>

<blockquote><p>I realized one thing about leadership during the period of exodus from the twelve worlds.</p></blockquote>

<p>At this point in time, Adama (the person who wrote this) is the leader of the human remnant - not many humans are left after the devastation that the Cylons had brought upon the twelve colonies (worlds). There is nothing left, only the <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> - their version of a battleship. The Battlestar, a few starfighters, some small merchant vessels, and not much else.</p>

<blockquote><p>A leader, no matter how benevolently he regards himself, has to be something of a tyrant.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most leaders (including myself) tend to regard ourselves as benevolent - such as SABDFL (Self Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life, AKA Mark Shuttleworth). Yet, a good leader, no matter how good they are, are going to attract a certain amount of dissent.</p>

<blockquote><p>If he lets everyone in on every phase of his plan, allows them to see the overpowering odds against them, he takes the risk they&#8217;ll become too discouraged to perform the little jobs that bring us forward through all the tedious phases.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the purposes of our discussion, to bring this into a parallel with Ubuntu, we&#8217;ll just pick the Unity discussion.</p>

<p>Mark has a plan. We don&#8217;t know what it is, because if we did, we&#8217;d realize the overpowering odds against us - we can see some of the odds (Apple, Microsoft), but others we can&#8217;t just yet (Android, Windows Phone 7).</p>

<p>Just a thought on leadership - not sure if it&#8217;s really on-topic, if I&#8221;m making sense, or anything like that, but I thought I&#8217;d bring this up anyway, since this was on my mind.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Feel free to shoot me an email at <code>james@jamesrgifford.com</code>. I look forward to any further thoughts on this topic you might have. :)</p>

    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/adventuresinwriting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know me, I have a tendency to start writing things that ever get to a readable state - and while that is (in theory)
great, I really wanted to start sharing - after all, sharing is caring! <!--more--></p>

<p>So, I created the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Gclb0UUwfnT7Pc3aKocM5RZiL4HEYjQfqhewaJEo1ZE">Little Orange Ubuntu Book</a> with the help
of Roland Taylor and a few other friends. Its not completely finished right now, but its in a good enough state where a friend of mine
(who A. is a writer and B. has been really harsh on my writing style in the past) told me that for the first week of her walk in Ubuntu
(I gave her my old netbook, pre-installed with Ubuntu on it), this book was extrememly helpful.</p>

<p>So, I think we can consider it a success. While Chapter 5 (Ubuntu One) isn&#8217;t ready just yet, that is being worked on and will be finished soon.</p>

<p>If you have comments/feedback/whatever on it, feel free to email me - I&#8217;m <code>jamesgifford@ubuntu.com</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, for those of you that don&#8217;t know, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UCADay">Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day</a> is the first day that we set apart to say &#8220;Thank you&#8221; to all the various folks who help make the Ubuntu Community possible, and awesome.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So, without furthur ado (whatever &#8220;ado&#8221; is!), I&#8217;ll start the list of lists (in absolutely no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://castrojo.tumblr.com/">Jorge Castro</a> - it was Jorge who really got me kickstarted in the Ubuntu Community.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/maasj">Jason Maas</a>. While I haven&#8217;t spoken (or even really communicated with him) in several years, this was the guy who introduced me to Ubuntu, so I have to thank him for that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wildbill">Bill Childers</a>. This guy taught me many tiny, newbie tricks, such as how to refresh the GRUB list (yeah, I didn&#8217;t know how to do that until he showed me). He also wrote an awesome (somewhat outdated, but awesome) book I have read many, many times.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://philipballew.wordpress.com/">Philip Ballew</a>. He&#8217;s awesome, if you&#8217;ve ever done anything with him, you&#8217;d know why. If you haven&#8217;t, I suggest you get started.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ubunturocking.wordpress.com/">Bilal Akhtar</a>. He&#8217;s more of an inspiration than anything else, mainly because he&#8217;s another young (he&#8217;s 15, same as me) <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ubuntero">Ubuntero</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://akgraner.com/">Amber Graner</a>. She&#8217;s done an awesome job of getting the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntuleadership">Ubuntu Leadership team</a> off the ground and to find it&#8217;s place in the existing Ubuntu ecosystem. Thanks!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://marcoceppi.com/">Marco Ceppi</a>. He&#8217;s an awesome guy, one of the excellent team of Community moderators on Ask Ubuntu. Without him, I wouldn&#8217;t spend (read: waste (in mom&#8217;s eyes)) half as much time in the community helping people as I do.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, I&#8217;ll leave you with this thought:</p>

<h3>Who do you appreciate in the community?</h3>

    <updated>2011-10-28T14:51:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/shoes-dot-rb-ppa-now-available</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&#8217;m happy to announce that the <a href="http://shoesrb.com">amazing Ruby GUI toolkit Shoes.rb</a> is now available in a PPA for Oneiric!</p>

<p>Right now, the packaging for <code>shoes</code> in the PPA isn&#8217;t really stable, so proceed with caution.</p>

<p>Ok, now that I&#8217;ve scared you all into your rabbit holes, the PPA to add is</p>

<p><code>ppa:jamesgifford/shoesrb</code></p>

<p>For instructions how to add PPAs on various versions of Ubuntu, <a href="http://askubuntu.com/q/4983/6005">take a look at this Ask Ubuntu question/answer set.</a></p>

<p>Bug reports should be <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/shoes/+filebug">filed here</a>, however if it&#8217;s not directly related to the packaging, I&#8217;ll probably have you <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues">report them to the upstream bug tracker</a>.</p>

    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/what-the-heck-fsf</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>A few nights ago, I recived the following email.</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Did you know that, like you, nearly 50% of the 40,000 subscribers to the FSF&#8217;s supporter mailing list have an @gmail.com email address?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>JavaScript, once lauded for adding simple visual effects to web pages, is now used by web sites like Gmail to run powerful</p>
<p>programs on your computer. These programs, like any other program running on your computer, should be free software. But</p>
<p>right now, the vast majority of JavaScript programs do not respect your essential freedoms to run, study, modify and share</p>
<p>them. They take control of your computer away from you; the same control we have been working for over 25 years to protect.</p>
<p>Because of the incredibly high percentage of Gmail-using free software supporters, we&#8217;re taking action to raise awareness</p>
<p>about how to use Gmail without using proprietary software. We&#8217;ll also be working on longer term solutions, but the most</p>
<p>immediate positive step to take is to stop running the proprietary programs.</p>
<p>Many people suggest that you shouldn&#8217;t use Gmail at all, because it means losing control over your data and privacy. We agree</p>
<p>that this is a very important factor for you to consider when choosing how you will handle your email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But since you are already using Gmail, please help us build momentum for change by not using the proprietary JavaScript on</p>
<p>your system &#8211; <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/jstrap/gmail?45645">and helping others to do the same</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>To this epistle, I have but one thing to say.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>WAKE UP. NAOW.</p>


<p>Seriously.&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>I read that, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jrgifford/status/67767779750723585">I tweeted the link</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Shortly thereafter, I got the following tweet.</p>


<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>firefly911 @jrgifford &nbsp;That&#8217;s pretty odd. I fully support open software, but if someone wants their code proprietary they have that right to.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(<em><a href="http://twitter.com/firefly911/status/67778728217939968">Link</a></em>)</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>So&#8230; what&#8217;s he saying there? I couldn&#8217;t understand it from all the proprietary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_the_Kool-Aid">kool-aid I&#8217;ve been drinking</a>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Exactly that. True freedom (I prefer the term &#8220;liberty&#8221; but that&#8217;s another story) is the right to <em>choose</em>. And that&nbsp;means that if they want to, they can make their codebase proprietary. As a matter of fact, I&#8217;m writing this on a Ubuntu Linux&nbsp;box (Free software), using the amazing Simplenote (not free) for my editor. Oh, and I&#8217;m using Google Chrome (Not completely free, although it does have a large amount of free components in it),&nbsp;because Firefox (Free) is a memory hog on my computer. And (Ya know, before I forget), I&#8217;m also using Dropbox (Not free) to&nbsp;backup the stuff I&#8217;m writing in Simplenote, and I&#8217;ve also got about 5-10 tabs open with * GASP * proprietary websites in&nbsp;them! WHO WOULDA THUNK IT?!?!?!?! O_O</p>


<p>My point is, people are going to use what WORKS. And until there are FOSS (Where FOSS = Free Open Source Software)&nbsp;alternatives that work as well (or (hopefully) better than) the competition, people won&#8217;t be changing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>I know a guy who still uses his AOL account for all his email.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Why?&nbsp;</p>


<p>Because it works. And yes, there are &#8220;better&#8221; alternatives out there. But it works.&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>And (<a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">as was stated in a open letter to RMS</a>)&nbsp;</p>


<p>&#8220;We live in a world where having the technological edge makes the difference between success and failure; asking us to just&nbsp;give up that edge for a theoretical idea of freedom is not going to work.&#8221;</p>


<p>And on that note, to the FSF, I have this to say.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>If you&#8217;re really about Freedom, then people have the right to make their codebase (software, artwork, etc) proprietary. And&nbsp;now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ll just go off and play one of those DRM&#8217;ed games that I bought for $.99 on the (proprietary) Apple AppStore, because&nbsp;for games, the (&#8220;Open Source&#8221;-but-not-really) Android just doesn&#8217;t seem to work well. Wonder why&#8230;</p>
