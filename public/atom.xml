    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/leadership-lessons-from-battlestar-galactica/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-08T09:06:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/leadership-lessons-from-battlestar-galactica</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I realized one thing about leadership during the period of exodus from the twelve worlds. A leader, no matter how benevolently he regards himself, has to be something of a tyrant. If he lets everyone in on every phase of his plan, allows them to see the <em>overpowering</em> odds against them, he takes the risk they&#8217;ll become too discouraged to perform the little jobs that bring us forward through all the tedious phases.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t normally look for leadership lessons in science fiction - but, when I was reading <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, this part stuck out at me.</p>

<p>Lets go through this piece by piece.</p>

<blockquote><p>I realized one thing about leadership during the period of exodus from the twelve worlds.</p></blockquote>

<p>At this point in time, Adama (the person who wrote this) is the leader of the human remnant - not many humans are left after the devastation that the Cylons had brought upon the twelve colonies (worlds). There is nothing left, only the <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> - their version of a battleship. The Battlestar, a few starfighters, some small merchant vessels, and not much else.</p>

<blockquote><p>A leader, no matter how benevolently he regards himself, has to be something of a tyrant.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most leaders (including myself) tend to regard ourselves as benevolent - such as SABDFL (Self Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life, AKA Mark Shuttleworth). Yet, a good leader, no matter how good they are, are going to attract a certain amount of dissent.</p>

<blockquote><p>If he lets everyone in on every phase of his plan, allows them to see the overpowering odds against them, he takes the risk they&#8217;ll become too discouraged to perform the little jobs that bring us forward through all the tedious phases.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the purposes of our discussion, to bring this into a parallel with Ubuntu, we&#8217;ll just pick the Unity discussion.</p>

<p>Mark has a plan. We don&#8217;t know what it is, because if we did, we&#8217;d realize the overpowering odds against us - we can see some of the odds (Apple, Microsoft), but others we can&#8217;t just yet (Android, Windows Phone 7).</p>

<p>Just a thought on leadership - not sure if it&#8217;s really on-topic, if I&#8221;m making sense, or anything like that, but I thought I&#8217;d bring this up anyway, since this was on my mind.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Feel free to shoot me an email at <code>james@jamesrgifford.com</code>. I look forward to any further thoughts on this topic you might have. :)</p>

    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/adventuresinwriting/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-26T08:46:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/adventuresinwriting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know me, I have a tendency to start writing things that ever get to a readable state - and while that is (in theory)
great, I really wanted to start sharing - after all, sharing is caring! <!--more--></p>

<p>So, I created the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Gclb0UUwfnT7Pc3aKocM5RZiL4HEYjQfqhewaJEo1ZE">Little Orange Ubuntu Book</a> with the help
of Roland Taylor and a few other friends. Its not completely finished right now, but its in a good enough state where a friend of mine
(who A. is a writer and B. has been really harsh on my writing style in the past) told me that for the first week of her walk in Ubuntu
(I gave her my old netbook, pre-installed with Ubuntu on it), this book was extrememly helpful.</p>

<p>So, I think we can consider it a success. While Chapter 5 (Ubuntu One) isn&#8217;t ready just yet, that is being worked on and will be finished soon.</p>

<p>If you have comments/feedback/whatever on it, feel free to email me - I&#8217;m <code>jamesgifford@ubuntu.com</code>.</p>

    <updated>2011-11-20T17:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/community-appreciation-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, for those of you that don&#8217;t know, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UCADay">Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day</a> is the first day that we set apart to say &#8220;Thank you&#8221; to all the various folks who help make the Ubuntu Community possible, and awesome.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So, without furthur ado (whatever &#8220;ado&#8221; is!), I&#8217;ll start the list of lists (in absolutely no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://castrojo.tumblr.com/">Jorge Castro</a> - it was Jorge who really got me kickstarted in the Ubuntu Community.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/maasj">Jason Maas</a>. While I haven&#8217;t spoken (or even really communicated with him) in several years, this was the guy who introduced me to Ubuntu, so I have to thank him for that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wildbill">Bill Childers</a>. This guy taught me many tiny, newbie tricks, such as how to refresh the GRUB list (yeah, I didn&#8217;t know how to do that until he showed me). He also wrote an awesome (somewhat outdated, but awesome) book I have read many, many times.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://philipballew.wordpress.com/">Philip Ballew</a>. He&#8217;s awesome, if you&#8217;ve ever done anything with him, you&#8217;d know why. If you haven&#8217;t, I suggest you get started.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ubunturocking.wordpress.com/">Bilal Akhtar</a>. He&#8217;s more of an inspiration than anything else, mainly because he&#8217;s another young (he&#8217;s 15, same as me) <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ubuntero">Ubuntero</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://akgraner.com/">Amber Graner</a>. She&#8217;s done an awesome job of getting the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntuleadership">Ubuntu Leadership team</a> off the ground and to find it&#8217;s place in the existing Ubuntu ecosystem. Thanks!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://marcoceppi.com/">Marco Ceppi</a>. He&#8217;s an awesome guy, one of the excellent team of Community moderators on Ask Ubuntu. Without him, I wouldn&#8217;t spend (read: waste (in mom&#8217;s eyes)) half as much time in the community helping people as I do.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, I&#8217;ll leave you with this thought:</p>

<h3>Who do you appreciate in the community?</h3>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&#8217;m happy to announce that the <a href="http://shoesrb.com">amazing Ruby GUI toolkit Shoes.rb</a> is now available in a PPA for Oneiric!</p>

<p>Right now, the packaging for <code>shoes</code> in the PPA isn&#8217;t really stable, so proceed with caution.</p>

<p>Ok, now that I&#8217;ve scared you all into your rabbit holes, the PPA to add is</p>

<p><code>ppa:jamesgifford/shoesrb</code></p>

<p>For instructions how to add PPAs on various versions of Ubuntu, <a href="http://askubuntu.com/q/4983/6005">take a look at this Ask Ubuntu question/answer set.</a></p>

<p>Bug reports should be <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/shoes/+filebug">filed here</a>, however if it&#8217;s not directly related to the packaging, I&#8217;ll probably have you <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues">report them to the upstream bug tracker</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/what-the-heck-fsf/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-11T20:17:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/what-the-heck-fsf</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>A few nights ago, I recived the following email.</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Did you know that, like you, nearly 50% of the 40,000 subscribers to the FSF&#8217;s supporter mailing list have an @gmail.com email address?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>JavaScript, once lauded for adding simple visual effects to web pages, is now used by web sites like Gmail to run powerful</p>
<p>programs on your computer. These programs, like any other program running on your computer, should be free software. But</p>
<p>right now, the vast majority of JavaScript programs do not respect your essential freedoms to run, study, modify and share</p>
<p>them. They take control of your computer away from you; the same control we have been working for over 25 years to protect.</p>
<p>Because of the incredibly high percentage of Gmail-using free software supporters, we&#8217;re taking action to raise awareness</p>
<p>about how to use Gmail without using proprietary software. We&#8217;ll also be working on longer term solutions, but the most</p>
<p>immediate positive step to take is to stop running the proprietary programs.</p>
<p>Many people suggest that you shouldn&#8217;t use Gmail at all, because it means losing control over your data and privacy. We agree</p>
<p>that this is a very important factor for you to consider when choosing how you will handle your email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But since you are already using Gmail, please help us build momentum for change by not using the proprietary JavaScript on</p>
<p>your system &#8211; <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/jstrap/gmail?45645">and helping others to do the same</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Free Software Foundation</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>To this epistle, I have but one thing to say.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>WAKE UP. NAOW.</p>


<p>Seriously.&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>I read that, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jrgifford/status/67767779750723585">I tweeted the link</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Shortly thereafter, I got the following tweet.</p>


<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>firefly911 @jrgifford &nbsp;That&#8217;s pretty odd. I fully support open software, but if someone wants their code proprietary they have that right to.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(<em><a href="http://twitter.com/firefly911/status/67778728217939968">Link</a></em>)</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>So&#8230; what&#8217;s he saying there? I couldn&#8217;t understand it from all the proprietary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_the_Kool-Aid">kool-aid I&#8217;ve been drinking</a>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Exactly that. True freedom (I prefer the term &#8220;liberty&#8221; but that&#8217;s another story) is the right to <em>choose</em>. And that&nbsp;means that if they want to, they can make their codebase proprietary. As a matter of fact, I&#8217;m writing this on a Ubuntu Linux&nbsp;box (Free software), using the amazing Simplenote (not free) for my editor. Oh, and I&#8217;m using Google Chrome (Not completely free, although it does have a large amount of free components in it),&nbsp;because Firefox (Free) is a memory hog on my computer. And (Ya know, before I forget), I&#8217;m also using Dropbox (Not free) to&nbsp;backup the stuff I&#8217;m writing in Simplenote, and I&#8217;ve also got about 5-10 tabs open with * GASP * proprietary websites in&nbsp;them! WHO WOULDA THUNK IT?!?!?!?! O_O</p>


<p>My point is, people are going to use what WORKS. And until there are FOSS (Where FOSS = Free Open Source Software)&nbsp;alternatives that work as well (or (hopefully) better than) the competition, people won&#8217;t be changing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>I know a guy who still uses his AOL account for all his email.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Why?&nbsp;</p>


<p>Because it works. And yes, there are &#8220;better&#8221; alternatives out there. But it works.&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>And (<a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">as was stated in a open letter to RMS</a>)&nbsp;</p>


<p>&#8220;We live in a world where having the technological edge makes the difference between success and failure; asking us to just&nbsp;give up that edge for a theoretical idea of freedom is not going to work.&#8221;</p>


<p>And on that note, to the FSF, I have this to say.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>If you&#8217;re really about Freedom, then people have the right to make their codebase (software, artwork, etc) proprietary. And&nbsp;now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ll just go off and play one of those DRM&#8217;ed games that I bought for $.99 on the (proprietary) Apple AppStore, because&nbsp;for games, the (&#8220;Open Source&#8221;-but-not-really) Android just doesn&#8217;t seem to work well. Wonder why&#8230;</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Email Setup Using Thunderbird]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/email-setup-using-thunderbird/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-08T20:35:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/email-setup-using-thunderbird</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use Gmail. And I use it for everything.</p>


<p>Contacts?</p>


<p>Yup.</p>


<p>Calendars?</p>


<p>Yup.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<!--more-->


<p>Now, I keep Google Chrome around for my main, everyday browsing. However, I do have <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a>&nbsp;around for a few things, mainly WebApps. Like Google Calendar and my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a>&nbsp;app, <a href="http://wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>However, I need to use Thunderbird for a lot of reasons, the big one is that I can&#8217;t do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP email</a> signing from Gmail. So, in order to use Thunderbird, I need to have a few things in place.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>1. <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/home/index.php.html">Engimail</a>.</p>


<p>2. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/zindus/">Zindus.</a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>That&#8217;s it. I install Enigmail and Zindus, hook them up to their respective accounts, and I&#8217;m set. It&#8217;s simple as that. And now that I&#8217;m using <a href="http://2buntu.com/index.php/archives/595">openbox as my window manager</a>, I can have Thunderbird running all the time without slowing down my netbook much. In fact, once I get my second GB of RAM, I probably won&#8217;t notice Thunderbird&#8217;s drain at all.&nbsp;</p>

Well, people don&#8217;t seem to like it, so for today&#8217;s part of the wordpress post a week challenge, I wrote something over on 2buntu.com about Unity, then and now.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://2buntu.com/index.php/archives/429">2buntu.com</a>, a site that I occasionally write for on varied topics, most of which have to do with my Ubuntu side.</em></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the cool new features (Among many) in Unity in 11.04 (Hereafter referred to as &#8220;Natty&#8221;) is <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/LauncherAPI#Static%20Quicklist%20entries">QuickLists</a>. QuickLists are this awesome new feature that let you have shortcuts in your Unity Launcher. I was a little bored today, so I created a <a href="https://launchpad.net/unity-quicklist-examples">project on launchpad</a> with some cool examples. So I decided &#8220;Hey, lets make a FileZilla quicklist&#8221;, so I fired up my trusty vim, and let &#8216;er rip. So, if you&#8217;re interested in getting ahold of these cool new QuickList, just run this command:</p>


<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
</span></p>


<p style="display: inline !important;"><code>sudo apt-get install bzr &amp;&amp; bzr branch lp:unity-quicklist-examples</code></p>


<p style="display: inline !important;">&nbsp;</p>


<p style="display: inline !important;">&nbsp;</p>


<p style="display: inline !important;">The first part will install bzr on your system (if you don&#8217;t already have it), and the second part will download the files for your perusal. Special thanks go to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mainerror">Octavian Damiean</a> for helping me with the FileZilla QuickList. Any questions/comments/concerns can be sent to <a href="mailto:james@jamesrgifford.com">james@jamesrgifford.com, or you can <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-quicklist-examples/+filebug">file a bug</a> in the Unity QuickList Examples Project.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/meet-the-new-chief-of-google-chrome-os/"/>
    <updated>2011-04-01T20:51:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/meet-the-new-chief-of-google-chrome-os</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, it&#8217;s come.
&nbsp;
Time for me to move on from Oaggle, Ubuntu and the rest of the Open Source World.
As of 12:00AM April 1st 2011, I was hired by &nbsp;Google to be their new head of the Chrome OS.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Before I get into details as to what I&#8217;ll be doing, I&#8217;d like to offer my congratulations to Roland Taylor <a href="https://2buntu.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/ubuntu-has-been-forked-no-seriously/">as he becomes the head of 2Buntu</a>, a new cloud-based competitor to Chrome OS.
As part of this sudden change, I&#8217;m going to be implementing a different way of doing things in the Chrome OS Department.
First, enough of this &#8220;Gentoo-based&#8221; stuff. The first thing we&#8217;re going to do is drop Gentoo (And by extension, the new&nbsp;Canterbury&nbsp;Distribution), and go with Google as our core. We&#8217;ll be running the same Debian-Gentoo-Fedora-Ubuntu-ARCH Beast that we run on our top-secret servers on Chrome OS.
&nbsp;
Second, there&#8217;s the matter of HTML5. I&#8217;ve decided that Chrome OS won&#8217;t be supporting HTML5, and shall instead move straight to HTML6, which doesn&#8217;t need <em>any coding <strong>at all</strong>. </em>For more details on this new&nbsp;technology, <a href="http://jamesrgifford.com/html6/" title="HTML6" target="_blank">please see this</a>.
&nbsp;
Third (And last), I&#8217;d like to thank the wonderful folks over at Oaggle.com for everything that they&#8217;ve done. You&#8217;re all awesome. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ryangould_">Ryan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/conrk">Conor</a>.</p>

<p><em>Please note that today is April 1st. Thank you</em></p>
