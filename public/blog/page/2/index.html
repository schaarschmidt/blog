  <div class="entry-content"><h2>This solution no longer works. I&#8217;m keeping it around because it is still one of the most visited blog posts.</h2>

<p>Citing a need to completely move their infrastructure, <a href="http://voices.canonical.com/ubuntuone/2013/02/04/notification-about-notes/">the Ubuntu One team announced that they will no longer be supporting note sync</a>.</p>

<p>As such, I have moved to <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, and very gladly fork over $6 a month to them for premium.</p>

<p>So, for those of you who know me, I&#8217;m pretty picky
about what I use for my syncing. And I have to be -
this is one of the more difficult parts of my electronic life,
and its even more difficult now.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with my requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>free as in beer if at all possible. Hey, I&#8217;m cheap.</li>
<li>clients for the following OS&#8217;s:

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>Android. (I know, I need to clean up my operating system variety)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some sort of folder structure, at least for the desktop.</li>
<li>Markdown is nice, but not required.</li>
</ul>


<p>Before I added Android to the mix, I had been using
PlainText and Dropbox. Worked wonderfully.
Now that I have an android device,
I&#8217;m moving to Ubuntu One notes, aka tomboy. Seems to work pretty well.</p>

<p>For Windows and Ubuntu clients, I&#8217;m using Tomboy.
For Android, I&#8217;m using <a href="https://launchpad.net/tomdroid">Tomdroid</a>,
and for iOS, I&#8217;m using a new one that doesn&#8217;t work on iOS6 (yet!),
but should get fixed soon, called
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webnotes-powered-by-ubuntu/id519580240?mt=8">webNotes (powered by Ubuntu One)</a>. All the platforms covered yay!</p>

<p>To get setup, I just installed Tomboy on my Ubuntu
and Windows computers.
I then installed the beta version of Tomdroid,
and connected everything to my Ubuntu One account.
Took about 20 minutes to do the switch, and was very painless!</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve been using Ubuntu One in this fashion for about three months,
and it&#8217;s going pretty well so far.</p>

<p>The ability to have my notes anywhere is great - and the fact it
integrates with a product made by one of my favorite companies (Canonical)
is even better!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I was a fairly competent and accomplished rails developer, for someone who was self taught, never had a job doing rails stuff, and who was young enough that a large part of the community is old enough be my dad.</p>

<p>And then I entered the Rails Rumble for 2012 with <a href="https://twitter.com/imnotanerd">@imnotanerd</a>, and spent a desperate 48 hours with my battling oauth, rails internals, Sinatra, cancan, and a Linux server.</p>

<p>At the end, I&#8217;ve got a few takeaways.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Come up with two ideas - one that only takes 12 hours to build, the other that takes the full 48.</p>

<p>This saved our bacon. We had two ideas - one was fairly complex. At 8PM Saturday I said &#8220;look. We&#8217;ve been banging our heads against this for almost 8 man hours. Time to start something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I did a rails new, and thus Volla was born. Or reborn.</p></li>
<li><p>Git is your frenemy.</p>

<p>Git is a blessing and a curse. Commit early, often, push, deploy via Capistrano, repeat.</p>

<p>But make sure that your gitignore is properly updated.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you end up committing 20mb worth of binstubs. And your api keys. Not OK.</p>

<p>Anyway. Don&#8217;t do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Stay on target&#8230;</p>

<p>Enough said. Don&#8217;t get distracted by the cool matrix cat or something.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#8217;t succeed, try again.
Take a month off, then try that idea again. I learned everything I know about rails because I said &#8220;I&#8217;ve got two weeks. Let&#8217;s building something in 2 hours a day&#8221;. (Side note: that&#8217;s how I got sucked into Shoes/Hackety Hack, as well as delayed_paperclip. You devote time to something, you will fill it. Fact of life that I&#8217;ve discovered over the past 16 years I&#8217;ve been around on this planet.)</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage the knowledge of others.</p>

<p>I did the math, and between the two of us, we spent 8 hours man hours trying to figure out sessions in Sinatra. It was at this point I said &#8220;stop and move on, lets get this fixed&#8221;. Time spent on authentication in rails? 20 minutes. (Authorization though, was closer to an hour, hour and a half)</p>

<p>The lesson to take away from this is that for almost everything you&#8217;re doing, someone has invented that wheel already - so for the love of pete, USE IT. Thats the wonderful thing about a community.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#8217;t know what adding $GEM to your gemfile will do, you probably don&#8217;t want to do it.</p>

<p>I ran into this - had a gem, added it, broke everything. Removed, worked fine. (Not naming names here, it was some bad code I wrote elsewhere). But adding <em>one</em> gem was enough to break the whole app.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a logged chat.</p>

<p>We used skype - this worked, but the logs in skype are&#8230; well, less than wonderful. Part of this has to do with Skype for Linux, part of this has to do with Skype in general. If I had to do it again, I&#8217;d use Campfire, or even IRC.</p></li>
<li><p>Descriptive git commits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fixed bugs&#8221; - If you&#8217;re guilty of this, raise your hand! Oh look, everyones hand went up.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t. Do. This. Ever. Makes code review after the fact hard.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#8217;re confident, do some sort of TDD.</p>

<p>This would have cost us time, but saved us trouble. If we had automated testing in place, I would have known that we broke certain things with certain other changes. But&#8230; well, hindsight is 20-20.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Hopefully my tips here will be useful for people in the future. If not, oh well. I tried. :)</p>
