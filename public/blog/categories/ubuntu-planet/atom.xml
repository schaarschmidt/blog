    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I realized one thing about leadership during the period of exodus from the twelve worlds. A leader, no matter how benevolently he regards himself, has to be something of a tyrant. If he lets everyone in on every phase of his plan, allows them to see the <em>overpowering</em> odds against them, he takes the risk they'll become too discouraged to perform the little jobs that bring us forward through all the tedious phases.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't normally look for leadership lessons in science fiction - but, when I was reading <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, this part stuck out at me.</p>

<p>Lets go through this piece by piece.</p>

<blockquote><p>I realized one thing about leadership during the period of exodus from the twelve worlds.</p></blockquote>

<p>At this point in time, Adama (the person who wrote this) is the leader of the human remnant - not many humans are left after the devastation that the Cylons had brought upon the twelve colonies (worlds). There is nothing left, only the <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> - their version of a battleship. The Battlestar, a few starfighters, some small merchant vessels, and not much else.</p>

<blockquote><p>A leader, no matter how benevolently he regards himself, has to be something of a tyrant.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most leaders (including myself) tend to regard ourselves as benevolent - such as SABDFL (Self Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life, AKA Mark Shuttleworth). Yet, a good leader, no matter how good they are, are going to attract a certain amount of dissent.</p>

<blockquote><p>If he lets everyone in on every phase of his plan, allows them to see the overpowering odds against them, he takes the risk they'll become too discouraged to perform the little jobs that bring us forward through all the tedious phases.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the purposes of our discussion, to bring this into a parallel with Ubuntu, we'll just pick the Unity discussion.</p>

<p>Mark has a plan. We don't know what it is, because if we did, we'd realize the overpowering odds against us - we can see some of the odds (Apple, Microsoft), but others we can't just yet (Android, Windows Phone 7).</p>

<p>Just a thought on leadership - not sure if it's really on-topic, if I"m making sense, or anything like that, but I thought I'd bring this up anyway, since this was on my mind.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Feel free to shoot me an email at <code>james@jamesrgifford.com</code>. I look forward to any further thoughts on this topic you might have. :)</p>

    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/community-appreciation-day/"/>

    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/community-appreciation-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, for those of you that don't know, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UCADay">Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day</a> is the first day that we set apart to say "Thank you" to all the various folks who help make the Ubuntu Community possible, and awesome.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So, without furthur ado (whatever "ado" is!), I'll start the list of lists (in absolutely no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://castrojo.tumblr.com/">Jorge Castro</a> - it was Jorge who really got me kickstarted in the Ubuntu Community.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/maasj">Jason Maas</a>. While I haven't spoken (or even really communicated with him) in several years, this was the guy who introduced me to Ubuntu, so I have to thank him for that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wildbill">Bill Childers</a>. This guy taught me many tiny, newbie tricks, such as how to refresh the GRUB list (yeah, I didn't know how to do that until he showed me). He also wrote an awesome (somewhat outdated, but awesome) book I have read many, many times.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://philipballew.wordpress.com/">Philip Ballew</a>. He's awesome, if you've ever done anything with him, you'd know why. If you haven't, I suggest you get started.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ubunturocking.wordpress.com/">Bilal Akhtar</a>. He's more of an inspiration than anything else, mainly because he's another young (he's 15, same as me) <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ubuntero">Ubuntero</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://akgraner.com/">Amber Graner</a>. She's done an awesome job of getting the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntuleadership">Ubuntu Leadership team</a> off the ground and to find it's place in the existing Ubuntu ecosystem. Thanks!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://marcoceppi.com/">Marco Ceppi</a>. He's an awesome guy, one of the excellent team of Community moderators on Ask Ubuntu. Without him, I wouldn't spend (read: waste (in mom's eyes)) half as much time in the community helping people as I do.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, I'll leave you with this thought:</p>

<h3>Who do you appreciate in the community?</h3>

    <link href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/shoes-dot-rb-ppa-now-available/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-28T14:51:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/shoes-dot-rb-ppa-now-available</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I'm happy to announce that the <a href="http://shoesrb.com">amazing Ruby GUI toolkit Shoes.rb</a> is now available in a PPA for Oneiric!</p>

<p>Right now, the packaging for <code>shoes</code> in the PPA isn't really stable, so proceed with caution.</p>

<p>Ok, now that I've scared you all into your rabbit holes, the PPA to add is</p>

<p><code>ppa:jamesgifford/shoesrb</code></p>

<p>For instructions how to add PPAs on various versions of Ubuntu, <a href="http://askubuntu.com/q/4983/6005">take a look at this Ask Ubuntu question/answer set.</a></p>

<p>Bug reports should be <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/shoes/+filebug">filed here</a>, however if it's not directly related to the packaging, I'll probably have you <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues">report them to the upstream bug tracker</a>.</p>
