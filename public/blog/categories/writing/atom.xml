    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those of you that don't know me, I have a tendency to start writing things that ever get to a readable state - and while that is (in theory)
great, I really wanted to start sharing - after all, sharing is caring! <!--more--></p>

<p>So, I created the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Gclb0UUwfnT7Pc3aKocM5RZiL4HEYjQfqhewaJEo1ZE">Little Orange Ubuntu Book</a> with the help
of Roland Taylor and a few other friends. Its not completely finished right now, but its in a good enough state where a friend of mine
(who A. is a writer and B. has been really harsh on my writing style in the past) told me that for the first week of her walk in Ubuntu
(I gave her my old netbook, pre-installed with Ubuntu on it), this book was extrememly helpful.</p>

<p>So, I think we can consider it a success. While Chapter 5 (Ubuntu One) isn't ready just yet, that is being worked on and will be finished soon.</p>

<p>If you have comments/feedback/whatever on it, feel free to email me - I'm <code>jamesgifford@ubuntu.com</code>.</p>
