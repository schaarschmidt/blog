  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;m sure most of us are aware, rails recently had some security holes brought to light and fixed.</p>

<p>These are my notes after upgrading about a dozen applications, many of them twice in the past month or two.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have a solid batch of unit tests, then the odds of my spending anytime on patching your open source project are nil. Well, not quiet. I&#8217;ve done a few.</p>

<p>But seriously, with tests, my workflow looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>read README. Make note of any special dependencies, like elasticsearch or postgres in development.</p></li>
<li><p>git clone.</p></li>
<li><p>create new rvm gemset.</p></li>
<li><p><code>bundle install</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>read through <code>config/database.yml</code>, change if needed to work with my setup. Changes are normally limited to things like the database name, the database user, password, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:create</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>rake db:migrate &amp;&amp; rake db:seed &amp;&amp; rake db:test:prepare</code></p></li>
<li><p>and then I run the tests - either <code>rake test</code>, <code>rspec spec</code> or <code>rake spec</code>. I&#8217;ve seen all three of them, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll see more variations as time goes on. Side note: For rails applications, we should always alias <code>rake test</code> to the testing framework that is being used.</p></li>
<li><p>if the tests all pass before I upgrade, I upgrade with <code>bundle update rails &amp;&amp; rake test</code>, if they don&#8217;t, then I try to make them pass (I normally can), but if I can&#8217;t, I and then update rails, re-run the tests, and make sure they are either all green, or that there are no new failures. (No more than 5% of the tests can fail).</p></li>
<li><p>commit, submit a pull request, ping the maintainer on twitter after 24 hours
if it isn&#8217;t merged.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Without tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>git clone</li>
<li><code>bundle install</code></li>
<li><code>rake db:migrate</code></li>
<li><code>rails server</code></li>
<li>poke around in the browser.</li>
<li><code>update rails</code></li>
<li>spend my time going through weird stacktaces and weird errors, or worse, not knowing if I broke something.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ew.</p>

<p>So, the take aways are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Documentation on how to get a fully functional dev environment, having tests, and having the code on github.</p></li>
<li><p>Test suites rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Readable code is also important - there were a few situations where the tests were failing, and I had to go through and read the code to understand <em>why</em>, and it was surprisingly easy to debug these applications - I&#8217;m sure that the test-driven design was also a big part of it, but there was also a certain element of &#8220;this is readable code, I can understand this&#8221;.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last day of August, 2012, I got a box in the mail. The contents? A 16GB Nexus 7. My first android device.</p>

<p>Since then, its been a fun ride, and I&#8217;ve learned the various cool tools out there for a IT person.</p>

<p>I do contract work with a nameless startup incubator in the area, and as part of that, I&#8217;m partially responsible for printers, user-facing documentation, etc.</p>

<p>As such, I was constantly plugging and unplugging my laptop to show people this, that or the other. <em>however</em>, the tablet has replaced my laptop for a lot of those duties. Let me explain more.</p>

<h3>Documentation.</h3>

<p>Like it or not, we all have to document things. And we have to do it well, for our intended audience. Now, we have two main pieces of user-facing documentation - the WiFi setup, and the printer setup. Two documents,one of which changes as we fix things (printers).</p>

<p>The Nexus 7 is just the right for me to pull of the document and refer to it as I&#8217;m working on someone&#8217;s machine. The apps I use for that are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dropbox. We use a shared dropbox folder to share the documents.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, to view them, I need a office type tool. While I could (and have) use Google drive, it doesn&#8217;t lend itself to the situation well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve looked at the softmaker line of products, but I haven&#8217;t been impressed with their linux offerings, so I&#8217;m not sure if I should risk the price for the full amount.</p>

<p>However, I am very happy with Kingston Office Writer.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5FvPpyWh.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4PHiEUlh.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s free, and available for Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.wps.moffice_eng">here</a>.</p>

<h3>SSH.</h3>

<p>The ConnectBot family is well-known and very well featured for being able to do SSH.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/issues/detail?id=369">I&#8217;ve discovered that stock ConnectBot doesn&#8217;t play nice with function keys</a> on bluetooth keyboards, so I am using a fork of ConnectBot called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.vx.connectbot">VX ConnectBot</a> that properly supports external keyboards.</p>

<p>ConnectBot supports SSH keys, although I don&#8217;t make use of them  - I don&#8217;t do enough SSH on my tablet to worry about that.</p>

<h3>Notes.</h3>

<p>Evernote. <a href="http://blog.jamesrgifford.com/dropbox-to-ubuntu-one-for-note-taking/">While I used to be a fan of Tomboy/Tomdroid/Ubuntu One</a>, recent events have pushed me into the Evernote fold. And I must say, it&#8217;s nice. I&#8217;m using it to write this blog post right now.</p>

<p>I shell out the cash each month for Evernote Premium, and while I&#8217;m enjoying it so far, there are a few &#8220;problems&#8221; I have with it, but I also had them with Tomboy.</p>

<ul>
<li>No <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> support. Really, everything should support markdown.</li>
<li>Search sucks. Always has, always will. Someday someone will make search that doesn&#8217;t suck, but that day has not yet come.</li>
<li>inline image embedding. For this, that&#8217;d be really nice. But oh well.</li>
</ul>


<h3>PDF Viewer.</h3>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> or the built-in PDF reader are my go-to PDF readers. They aren&#8217;t terrific, but they are ok.</p>

<h3>Email.</h3>

<p>Ahg. Email, the bane of every IT persons existence. Email is something I detest.
People need to understand that when they email me, I will see it, and then prioritize it. I&#8217;m sad that people think that emailing me = instant response and I go and fix their problem. If you email someone, you should expect up to a 72 hour wait period before you get a response. If it&#8217;s that important, call me. The important people have my number, and the smart ones who might need to call me know where and how to find it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I use the excellent gmail app for my email. I have gmail filters setup server side that filter out mailing lists and similar things into gmail tags, so they never hit my inbox. I then have gmail setup to only send me a push notification if it&#8217;s in the priority inbox.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JHwDDdf.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So, lets bits and pieces that don&#8217;t really fall into any category are:</p>

<p>More communication tools: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider">Skype</a> , Google Talk (no link that I could find in the Play Store) and for IRC, I&#8217;m a fan of [AndChat(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.andchat). <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googlevoice">Google Voice</a> is another good one, if you&#8217;re a Google Voice user, I highly recommend installing the application - while I still haven&#8217;t figured out how to make calls from my Nexus 7, for text messages, it works fine. Lastly, for those times that Skype is just being a pain in the rear, there is Google + Hangouts, which are pretty useful.</p>

<h3>Web Browser</h3>

<p>For choice of Browser, I have two installed. I have <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.beta">Chrome Beta</a>, and I have <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">Firefox</a>. My main browser is Chrome, and I have Firefox for accessing all the internal sites that require self-signed SSL certificates. I much prefer Chromes tab setup, but Firefox is pretty fast.</p>

<h3>Password management:</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m cheap, remember? So I am a fan of <a href="http://keepass.info">keepass</a> and Dropbox.</p>

<p>So I store my passwords in a Keepass2 (or KeepassX) database, synced to my Dropbox folder. On my Tablet, I use keepassdroid to access it, and it&#8217;s all hunky dory.</p>

<p>Other tools I&#8217;ve tried are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://upm.sourceforge.net">Universal Password Manager</a>. I can&#8217;t explain why, but something about it not being in the archive for Ubuntu just made me not want to deal with it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>. Only way to get the mobile apps is the give them money, and I&#8217;m not a fan of proprietary applications storing something like my passwords. At least in dropbox, everything is a file.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Todo list:</h3>

<p>I use a combination of <a href="http://todotxt.com/">todo.txt</a> and <a href="http://wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure how well it&#8217;s working. Ask me in a few months.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s my list of tools. What is in your toolbox?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>What follows is not a fictional account, but some details have been changed to protect the innocent.</h3>

<p>There are two types of people in the entrepreneurship community.</p>

<p>Doers, and fund-seekers.</p>

<p>Or, as it is commonly boiled down to on many circles, developers, and the suits.</p>

<p>But like all analogies, it isn&#8217;t a good one - in other words, sometimes you can&#8217;t call an apple an apple, and an orange an orange. The lines get blurred, but this blog post is to highlight some of the differences.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was at a event at the local incubator - a bit of a networking event, community outreach, lunch, and just a general meet and greet event.</p>

<p>Halfway through lunch, a local investor arrived, and did a quick pitch to the massed and attentive throng. As he finished, he announced that he would be off in another part of the building, answering questions.</p>

<p>(there was a previous local investor who had announced the same thing, but I wasn&#8217;t in the room at the time, and therefore I can&#8217;t comment on it.)</p>

<p>It was then that I noticed there were <strong>two</strong> groups of people in the room.</p>

<p>Those who had projects, and those who had ideas. It showed itself in how they composed themselves around the investor. Those who had projects were mildly (and dare I say politely) interested in what he had to say, but there wasn&#8217;t a serious interest</p>

<p>On the other hand, the suits/&#8221;fund-seekers&#8221; reminded me more of a pack of wolves than a group of people who were there to conduct business.</p>

<p>After the the second local investor finished talking, he headed over to his area and took a seat. Within moments, the group had split three ways - one group went to the investor that mentioned a smaller amount of money, another went to the larger-scale investor, and a <em>very</em> small group went and grabbed more food, some coffee, returned to their laptops, and went to work.</p>

<p>The parallel and contrast was striking.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you have those who had &#8220;real work&#8221; to do, and on the other, you had those whose entire purpose of being there was to wine and dine the people with money, and leave those who would probably eventually provide the sweat, blood and tears that all products require to go and invest some sweat, blood and tears.</p>

<p>So, tell me: is this what being an entrepreneur is all about? Are the people who build things not important? Are people <em>that</em> intimidated to learn how to do something (like learn to code) for themselves, so they can ship?</p>

<p><img src="http://shipitsquirrel.github.com/images/ship%20it%20squirrel.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Excuse me, I&#8217;ve spent enough time writing this. Back to shipping folks.</p>
