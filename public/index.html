  <div class="entry-content"><h3>What follows is not a fictional account, but some details have been changed to protect the innocent.</h3>

<p>There are two types of people in the entrepreneurship community.</p>

<p>Doers, and fund-seekers.</p>

<p>Or, as it is commonly boiled down to on many circles, developers, and the suits.</p>

<p>But like all analogies, it isn&#8217;t a good one - in other words, sometimes you can&#8217;t call an apple an apple, and an orange an orange. The lines get blurred, but this blog post is to highlight some of the differences.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was at a event at the local incubator - a bit of a networking event, community outreach, lunch, and just a general meet and greet event.</p>

<p>Halfway through lunch, a local investor arrived, and did a quick pitch to the massed and attentive throng. As he finished, he announced that he would be off in another part of the building, answering questions.</p>

<p>(there was a previous local investor who had announced the same thing, but I wasn&#8217;t in the room at the time, and therefore I can&#8217;t comment on it.)</p>

<p>It was then that I noticed there were <strong>two</strong> groups of people in the room.</p>

<p>Those who had projects, and those who had ideas. It showed itself in how they composed themselves around the investor. Those who had projects were mildly (and dare I say politely) interested in what he had to say, but there wasn&#8217;t a serious interest</p>

<p>On the other hand, the suits/&#8221;fund-seekers&#8221; reminded me more of a pack of wolves than a group of people who were there to conduct business.</p>

<p>After the the second local investor finished talking, he headed over to his area and took a seat. Within moments, the group had split three ways - one group went to the investor that mentioned a smaller amount of money, another went to the larger-scale investor, and a <em>very</em> small group went and grabbed more food, some coffee, returned to their laptops, and went to work.</p>

<p>The parallel and contrast was striking.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you have those who had &#8220;real work&#8221; to do, and on the other, you had those whose entire purpose of being there was to wine and dine the people with money, and leave those who would probably eventually provide the sweat, blood and tears that all products require to go and invest some sweat, blood and tears.</p>

<p>So, tell me: is this what being an entrepreneur is all about? Are the people who build things not important? Are people <em>that</em> intimidated to learn how to do something (like learn to code) for themselves, so they can ship?</p>

<p><img src="http://shipitsquirrel.github.com/images/ship%20it%20squirrel.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Excuse me, I&#8217;ve spent enough time writing this. Back to shipping folks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Howdy! This is your chance to learn <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

<p>But more importantly, to learn how to <strong>think</strong> like a developer. How to solve problems. How to go through an application life cycle. How to break the problems down into the smallest chunk, so that you can solve it.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="http://www.launchhouse.com/">Shaker LaunchHouse</a>, in Shaker Heights, Ohio.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> July 1st through the 12th, 9:00am-6pm weekdays, with optional half Saturdays and Sundays. <strong>Thatâ€™s 100 hours of solid, in-depth and hands on instruction.</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s a lot of money. But you&#8217;re paying for some <strong>top-notch teaching</strong> and experiences!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an opportunity to learn how to think like a developer, and know how to take the next steps towards being able to build your own product.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year, as part of an attempt to spread holiday cheer,
Stack Exchange has decided to do a winter hat bash.</p>

<p>so, you might see something like this when you login to Ask Ubuntu today:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/e4yeU.png" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve managed to earn the Gangnam style glasses, Guide my Sleigh, and Constantipolitan, for posting on meta.</p>

<p>Full list of hats is <a href="http://winterba.sh/">here</a> - I implore you, go forth and earn hats!
And if you dislike hats, there is an opt-out button - just click the &#8220;i hate hats&#8221; link, and you won&#8217;t see any hats.</p>

<p>Just remember, hats are only around from now until Janurary 4th, so be quick!</p>

<p>Now hat Away! Hat Away! Hat Away All!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, for those of you who know me, I&#8217;m pretty picky
about what I use for my syncing. And I have to be -
this is one of the more difficult parts of my electronic life,
and its even more difficult now.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with my requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>free as in beer if at all possible. Hey, I&#8217;m cheap.</li>
<li>clients for the following OS&#8217;s:

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>Android. (I know, I need to clean up my operating system variety)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some sort of folder structure, at least for the desktop.</li>
<li>Markdown is nice, but not required.</li>
</ul>


<p>Before I added Android to the mix, I had been using
PlainText and Dropbox. Worked wonderfully.
Now that I have an android device,
I&#8217;m moving to Ubuntu One notes, aka tomboy. Seems to work pretty well.</p>

<p>For Windows and Ubuntu clients, I&#8217;m using Tomboy.
For Android, I&#8217;m using <a href="https://launchpad.net/tomdroid">Tomdroid</a>,
and for iOS, I&#8217;m using a new one that doesn&#8217;t work on iOS6 (yet!),
but should get fixed soon, called
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webnotes-powered-by-ubuntu/id519580240?mt=8">webNotes (powered by Ubuntu One)</a>. All the platforms covered yay!</p>

<p>To get setup, I just installed Tomboy on my Ubuntu
and Windows computers.
I then installed the beta version of Tomdroid,
and connected everything to my Ubuntu One account.
Took about 20 minutes to do the switch, and was very painless!</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;ve been using Ubuntu One in this fashion for about three months,
and it&#8217;s going pretty well so far.</p>

<p>The ability to have my notes anywhere is great - and the fact it
integrates with a product made by one of my favorite companies (Canonical)
is even better!</p>
