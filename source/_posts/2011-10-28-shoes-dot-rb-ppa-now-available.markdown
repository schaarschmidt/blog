Today, I'm happy to announce that the [amazing Ruby GUI toolkit Shoes.rb](http://shoesrb.com) is now available in a PPA for Oneiric!

Right now, the packaging for `shoes` in the PPA isn't really stable, so proceed with caution.

Ok, now that I've scared you all into your rabbit holes, the PPA to add is 

`ppa:jamesgifford/shoesrb`

For instructions how to add PPAs on various versions of Ubuntu, [take a look at this Ask Ubuntu question/answer set.](http://askubuntu.com/q/4983/6005)

Bug reports should be [filed here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/shoes/+filebug), however if it's not directly related to the packaging, I'll probably have you [report them to the upstream bug tracker](https://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues).
