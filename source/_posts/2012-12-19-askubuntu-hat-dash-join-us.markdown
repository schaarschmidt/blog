This year, as part of an attempt to spread holiday cheer,
Stack Exchange has decided to do a winter hat bash.

so, you might see something like this when you login to Ask Ubuntu today:

![enter image description here][1]

So far, I've managed to earn the Gangnam style glasses, Guide my Sleigh, and Constantipolitan, for posting on meta. 

Full list of hats is [here](http://winterba.sh/) - I implore you, go forth and earn hats!
And if you dislike hats, there is an opt-out button - just click the "i hate hats" link, and you won't see any hats. 

Just remember, hats are only around from now until Janurary 4th, so be quick! 

Now hat Away! Hat Away! Hat Away All!
