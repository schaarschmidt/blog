So, for those of you that don't know, [Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UCADay) is the first day that we set apart to say "Thank you" to all the various folks who help make the Ubuntu Community possible, and awesome. 
<!-- more -->

So, without furthur ado (whatever "ado" is!), I'll start the list of lists (in absolutely no particular order):

- [Jorge Castro](http://castrojo.tumblr.com/) - it was Jorge who really got me kickstarted in the Ubuntu Community.

- [Jason Maas](https://twitter.com/#!/maasj). While I haven't spoken (or even really communicated with him) in several years, this was the guy who introduced me to Ubuntu, so I have to thank him for that.

- [Bill Childers](https://twitter.com/#!/wildbill). This guy taught me many tiny, newbie tricks, such as how to refresh the GRUB list (yeah, I didn't know how to do that until he showed me). He also wrote an awesome (somewhat outdated, but awesome) book I have read many, many times.

- [Philip Ballew](http://philipballew.wordpress.com/). He's awesome, if you've ever done anything with him, you'd know why. If you haven't, I suggest you get started.

- [Bilal Akhtar](http://ubunturocking.wordpress.com/). He's more of an inspiration than anything else, mainly because he's another young (he's 15, same as me) [Ubuntero](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ubuntero).

- [Amber Graner](http://akgraner.com/). She's done an awesome job of getting the [Ubuntu Leadership team](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntuleadership) off the ground and to find it's place in the existing Ubuntu ecosystem. Thanks!

- [Marco Ceppi](http://marcoceppi.com/). He's an awesome guy, one of the excellent team of Community moderators on Ask Ubuntu. Without him, I wouldn't spend (read: waste (in mom's eyes)) half as much time in the community helping people as I do. 

So, I'll leave you with this thought:


###Who do you appreciate in the community?
