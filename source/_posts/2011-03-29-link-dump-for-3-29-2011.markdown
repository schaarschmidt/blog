Here's one last link, and here's why I'm putting this one in a special place: it's about Ruby. I've gotten <strong>sick and tired</strong> of the fact there is no definitive guide to installing Ruby (And rails, as well as all of those other Gems) on Ubuntu. I've read some stuff, but for the most part, any sort of a "Installing tutorial" is non-existent. So, being the complete sucker that I am, I created this over the weekend:
Installing Ruby on Rails and RVM (Ruby Version Manager) in Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04. [<a href="https://github.com/jrgifford/Tutorials/blob/master/ruby-on-rails-ubuntu.markdown">link</a>]
&nbsp;
Tell me what you think, and I'll be updating it with (If anything changes) fairly regularly. If you encounter an error, let me know, and I'll figure out what's going on (If it's my fault, or if something with the packages changed - I'm not responsible for fixing your computer).
