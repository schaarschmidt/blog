<p>I use Gmail. And I use it for everything.</p>
<p>Contacts?</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Calendars?</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I keep Google Chrome around for my main, everyday browsing. However, I do have <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a>&nbsp;around for a few things, mainly WebApps. Like Google Calendar and my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a>&nbsp;app, <a href="http://wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I need to use Thunderbird for a lot of reasons, the big one is that I can't do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP email</a> signing from Gmail. So, in order to use Thunderbird, I need to have a few things in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/home/index.php.html">Engimail</a>.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/zindus/">Zindus.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it. I install Enigmail and Zindus, hook them up to their respective accounts, and I'm set. It's simple as that. And now that I'm using <a href="http://2buntu.com/index.php/archives/595">openbox as my window manager</a>, I can have Thunderbird running all the time without slowing down my netbook much. In fact, once I get my second GB of RAM, I probably won't notice Thunderbird's drain at all.&nbsp;</p>
