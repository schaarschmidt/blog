Howdy! This is your chance to learn [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

But more importantly, to learn how to **think** like a developer. How to solve problems. How to go through an application life cycle. How to break the problems down into the smallest chunk, so that you can solve it.

**Location:** [Shaker LaunchHouse](http://www.launchhouse.com/), in Shaker Heights, Ohio.

**Date:** July 1st through the 12th, 9:00am-6pm weekdays, with optional half Saturdays and Sundays. **Thatâ€™s 100 hours of solid, in-depth and hands on instruction.**

**Cost** is $1,000 per person.

Yeah, that's a lot of money. But you're paying for some **top-notch teaching** and experiences!

It's an opportunity to learn how to think like a developer, and know how to take the next steps towards being able to build your own product.
