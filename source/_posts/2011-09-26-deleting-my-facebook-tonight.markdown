<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2011/09/25/facebooks-eerie-goal-why-timeline-changes-everything/">It's truly the end of the world as we know it.</a></p>
<p>After Facebook's latest changes, I'm deleting my Facebook profile on Wednesday (that is, 9/28/2011) night. So, connect with me through the various services I've got listed over here, at&nbsp;<a href="http://jamesrgifford.com/">http://jamesrgifford.com/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email: james @ jamesrgifford.com</p>
<p>Txt number: 216-223-8574.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't contact me through those, then I probably don't want to talk to you (no offense meant, just saying).</p>
