Well, it's come.
&nbsp;
Time for me to move on from Oaggle, Ubuntu and the rest of the Open Source World.
As of 12:00AM April 1st 2011, I was hired by &nbsp;Google to be their new head of the Chrome OS.
<!--more-->
Before I get into details as to what I'll be doing, I'd like to offer my congratulations to Roland Taylor <a href="https://2buntu.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/ubuntu-has-been-forked-no-seriously/">as he becomes the head of 2Buntu</a>, a new cloud-based competitor to Chrome OS.
As part of this sudden change, I'm going to be implementing a different way of doing things in the Chrome OS Department.
First, enough of this "Gentoo-based" stuff. The first thing we're going to do is drop Gentoo (And by extension, the new&nbsp;Canterbury&nbsp;Distribution), and go with Google as our core. We'll be running the same Debian-Gentoo-Fedora-Ubuntu-ARCH Beast that we run on our top-secret servers on Chrome OS.
&nbsp;
Second, there's the matter of HTML5. I've decided that Chrome OS won't be supporting HTML5, and shall instead move straight to HTML6, which doesn't need <em>any coding <strong>at all</strong>. </em>For more details on this new&nbsp;technology, <a href="http://jamesrgifford.com/html6/" title="HTML6" target="_blank">please see this</a>.
&nbsp;
Third (And last), I'd like to thank the wonderful folks over at Oaggle.com for everything that they've done. You're all awesome. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ryangould_">Ryan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/conrk">Conor</a>.
<p><em>Please note that today is April 1st. Thank you</em></p>
