###What follows is not a fictional account, but some details have been changed to protect the innocent.

There are two types of people in the entrepreneurship community.

Doers, and fund-seekers.

Or, as it is commonly boiled down to on many circles, developers, and the suits.

But like all analogies, it isn't a good one - in other words, sometimes you can't call an apple an apple, and an orange an orange. The lines get blurred, but this blog post is to highlight some of the differences.


A few weeks ago, I was at a event at the local incubator - a bit of a networking event, community outreach, lunch, and just a general meet and greet event.

Halfway through lunch, a local investor arrived, and did a quick pitch to the massed and attentive throng. As he finished, he announced that he would be off in another part of the building, answering questions.

(there was a previous local investor who had announced the same thing, but I wasn't in the room at the time, and therefore I can't comment on it.)

It was then that I noticed there were **two** groups of people in the room.

Those who had projects, and those who had ideas. It showed itself in how they composed themselves around the investor. Those who had projects were mildly (and dare I say politely) interested in what he had to say, but there wasn't a serious interest


On the other hand, the suits/"fund-seekers" reminded me more of a pack of wolves than a group of people who were there to conduct business.


After the the second local investor finished talking, he headed over to his area and took a seat. Within moments, the group had split three ways - one group went to the investor that mentioned a smaller amount of money, another went to the larger-scale investor, and a *very* small group went and grabbed more food, some coffee, returned to their laptops, and went to work.


The parallel and contrast was striking.

On the one hand, you have those who had "real work" to do, and on the other, you had those whose entire purpose of being there was to wine and dine the people with money, and leave those who would probably eventually provide the sweat, blood and tears that all products require to go and invest some sweat, blood and tears.

So, tell me: is this what being an entrepreneur is all about? Are the people who build things not important? Are people *that* intimidated to learn how to do something (like learn to code) for themselves, so they can ship?

Excuse me, I've spent enough time writing this. Back to shipping folks.
