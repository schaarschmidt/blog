<p>One of the cool new features (Among many) in Unity in 11.04 (Hereafter referred to as "Natty") is <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/LauncherAPI#Static%20Quicklist%20entries">QuickLists</a>. QuickLists are this awesome new feature that let you have shortcuts in your Unity Launcher. I was a little bored today, so I created a <a href="https://launchpad.net/unity-quicklist-examples">project on launchpad</a> with some cool examples. So I decided "Hey, lets make a FileZilla quicklist", so I fired up my trusty vim, and let 'er rip. So, if you're interested in getting ahold of these cool new QuickList, just run this command:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
</span></p><p style="display: inline !important;"><code>sudo apt-get install bzr &amp;&amp; bzr branch lp:unity-quicklist-examples</code></p>
<p style="display: inline !important;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="display: inline !important;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="display: inline !important;">The first part will install bzr on your system (if you don't already have it), and the second part will download the files for your perusal. Special thanks go to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mainerror">Octavian Damiean</a> for helping me with the FileZilla QuickList. Any questions/comments/concerns can be sent to <a href="mailto:james@jamesrgifford.com">james@jamesrgifford.com, or you can <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-quicklist-examples/+filebug">file a bug</a> in the Unity QuickList Examples Project.</p>
