<a href="http://hotot.org" title="Hotot - Get Hotot!">Hotot</a> is a fairly new Twitter client (It isn't even out of Beta - It's like a Google Project or something! ;) ) that's got my attention - in a good way. <em>(Please note that I won't write a scathing review about a piece of FOSS Software. I'll just file bug reports and spam your email). </em>Anyway, I've been using it, and I've been enjoying it - it's a nice little piece of software.

Anyway, here's a quick little preview of it.
&nbsp;
Hotot is a simple Twitter client, arranged in a column style, much like TweetDeck.

What are the various features that are available?
A lot. You've got URL shortening, Img.ly and TwitPic uploading, Send to Instapaper (I love that feature!), and image previews for a lot of image services. (Examples include Instagram. TwitPic and img.ly, among others).
&nbsp;
So, now that I've impressed you with Hotot's awesome features, how can you install this? Thankfully, there is a PPA (Personal Package Archive) that you can use to install it - however, beware - Hotot is still in beta, and while I haven't had anything bad happen because of it,<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/your_mileage_may_vary#Synonyms"> your&nbsp;mileage&nbsp;may vary.</a>
&nbsp;
Here's all you need to put into your terminal in order to install Hotot:
Open up a Terminal (Alt-F2, type in <code>gnome-terminal</code>), then copy and paste this command <p><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hotot-team &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install hotot -y </code></p> into the terminal, <em>(like <a href="http://lts.cr/T6D">this</a>)</em> hit enter, enter in your password when you get asked for it (Note: You won't see your password, and it won't display ***** when you enter it. That's normal and "OK".), then sit back, grab yourself a cup of coffee, come back in about five minutes, and you'll be set. You can launch Hotot by looking in your Applications menu in the "Internet" section.
